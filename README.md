 Import of Alpha and Delta variants during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland: phylogenetic analysis and intervention scenarios
 
 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the emergence of various variants of concern (VoC), characterized by viral changes, which is increased transmissibility, immune evasion, and differences in severity. The emergence of VoCs fueled the urgency to understand the potential impact of surveillance strategies to delay the early spread of VoC. The potential of such control measures as border closures, travel bans and surveillance of travelers to prevent transmission of VoCs is not fully understood. Following this ambiguity about the spread of Voc, specifically Alpha and Delta, in Switzerland, we used genomic data in combination with a transmission model. We estimated the imports of VoCs with phylogeny to then parameterize a dynamic transmission model simulating the spread of VoCs in Switzerland. Finally, we estimated 383 to 1,038 imports of Alpha from and 455 to 1,347 imports of Delta into Switzerland using sequences openly shared prior to 1 August 2021. We analyzed counterfactual scenarios to quantify the impact of border closures and different levels of surveillance on the spread of new VoCs. We found that comprehensive surveillance and controlling is needed before VoCs spread. Complete border closures after alert of new VoCs is of limited impact, but surveillance of travelers could remain useful in certain situations.
